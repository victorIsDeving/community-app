### 1. Install Node.js and npm
Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. You can check this by running:

bash
	node -v
	npm -v

If you don’t have them installed, download and install them from Node.js official website.

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Open a terminal and change the directory to the root of the cloned project:

bash
	cd /path/to/your/project

### 3. Install Project Dependencies
Use npm to manage dependencies. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

bash
	npm install

### 4. Start the Development Server
After installing dependencies, you can start the development server with:

bash
	npm start

This should launch the React development server, usually accessible at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

### 5. Open the Application in Your Browser
If it doesn’t automatically open, manually go to http://localhost:3000.
